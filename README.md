# 🧠 SemioLLM: Evaluating Large Language Models for Diagnostic Reasoning from Unstructured Clinical Narratives in Epilepsy
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/971867255.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18455275)

## Overview

SemioLLM is a comprehensive evaluation framework for assessing Large Language Models (LLMs) in medical diagnostic reasoning tasks. This project specifically focuses on diagnostic reasoning from unstructured clinical narratives in epilepsy, while also demonstrating domain transfer capabilities to other medical domains such as dermatology.

## 🎯 Key Features

### Main Research Focus
- **Epilepsy Diagnostic Reasoning**: Comprehensive evaluation of LLMs for epilepsy diagnosis from clinical narratives
- **Multi-Model Comparison**: Comparative analysis across different LLM architectures
- **Reasoning Analysis**: In-depth interpretability into models performance via reasoning and source citation analysis

### Domain Transfer Capabilities
- **Cross-Domain Generalization**: Demonstration of model performance across different medical specialties
- **Dermatology Case Study**: Proof-of-concept implementation for skin condition diagnosis. We evaluate LLM performance on mapping skin anomaly symptoms to likelihood of acne, psoriasis, fungal infection, impetigo, chicken pox, or others. We find that CoT prompting showed a 15% improvement over zero-shot for domain experts and, different AI personas affect diagnostic performance.


## 🚀 Getting Started
